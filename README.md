## Assignemnt
They should all be 100 %

##Java Version
To get all code runs correctly, please use java 8
1. Assignment 6 use some function programming...
2. String implementation changed since java 7 update 6 (This should affect me, but if you want to modify code based on mine, that would be a problem)

##Problems
I know I didn't fix the style problem, which I really don't care...

I know I put all the code in the default package. However, in this way, I don't need to delete the package line everytime I submit

If there is anything interesting you find in my code, please don't be hastitate to contact me
